# Log Bounty Program

I believe the key for high quality SIEM are following factors:

* DLPS - Data Loss Prevention System
* Realtime analysis and actions
* Fast parsers - high EPS (Events Per Second)
* Advanced editor for parsing rules
* Easy and reliable parsing rules

In real world we need to monitor and analyze many kind of messages from different sources.
But i have no opportunity to get samples of messages from any kind of device/software.
So if you want support this project with anonymized logs from your device/software,
please write mail to opensiem.net@gmail.com i will buy you a beer :)
